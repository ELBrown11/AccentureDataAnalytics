Through The Forage's virtual internship experience, I participated in the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization program through The Forage platform. The program encompassed four main tasks: understanding the project, cleaning and modeling the data, visualizing the data, creating a narrative, and presenting the findings to the client. The experience provided valuable hands-on practice in data analysis and allowed me to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and communication. It also simulated real-world scenarios, offering insights into the roles and responsibilities of a data analyst.
